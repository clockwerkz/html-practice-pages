# html-practice-pages
A simple repository to practice building some basic html pages

## CSS and BEM
I'm using this first html page as a practice page for using BEM. BEM, or Block Element Modifier, is a CSS methodology - a naming convention that makes for very shallow css class names, and helps prevent specificity problems. It takes a bit to wrap my head around it, so I figured I'd practice it on some simple sites.

### Dance Studio Page
This page is based on a final project design from a student at Design Lab.

*Dance Studio Page Notes*
I ended up building my own Image Slider with Vanila JavaScript. I wanted an image slider that would slide images from one direction to another, and I couldn't find one that offered that feature.
