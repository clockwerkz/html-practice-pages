A simple repository to practice building some basic html pages

## CSS and BEM
I'm using this first html page as a practice page for using BEM. BEM, or Block Element Modifier, is a CSS methodology - a naming convention that makes for very shallow css class names, and helps prevent specificity problems. It takes a bit to wrap my head around it, so I figured I'd practice it on some simple sites.
